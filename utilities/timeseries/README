This folder contains two tools for data translating structured time series data. The first, extract_spreadsheet.py, will translate an Excel spreadsheet into a JSON representation. The second, triplify.py, will convert the JSON representation into a list of triples.

---
extract_spreadsheet.py
Takes as input JSON annotation file, an Excel spreadsheet (or CSV file), and an output filename.
The script loads the JSON annotations, then parses each sheet in the Excel spreadsheet, storing the output into the supplied file (overwriting if the file exists).
The output format is JSON, consisting of an array of data from each sheet or tab in the Excel file. For a single sheet, the output is an array of time series objects with two keys - metadata and timeseries (ts). The metadata is a key-value dictionary of metadata properties. The ts field is an array of tuples of the form (time, value).

Dependencies:
argparse
pyexcel
pyexcel-xls 
pyexcel-xlsx
demjson

Usage:
extract_spreadsheet.py <annotation> <spreadsheet> <output>

Example:
extract_spreadsheet.py annotations\DIESEL_june\ 2017.json DIESEL_june\ 2017.xlsx results\DIESEL_june_2017.json

Data and annotations can be found at ./examples
